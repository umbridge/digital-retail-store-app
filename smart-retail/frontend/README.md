# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Objective : To help user easily clone and run the app.

## CLONING STEPS:
 1. Cloning the React App
  ∘ Creating a New Folder
  ∘ Getting the Code URL
  ∘ Cloning the React app's Github Repo
 2. Check if npm and node is installed in your system.
  ∘ Check the installation using "npm --version" and "node --version".
  ∘ If not present then install them using the commands "npm install -g npm" for npm and (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for node.
 3. Configuring your Cloned App
  ∘ The node_modules install using the command "npm install".
  ∘ Check if the node_module and package-lock.json is created.
 4. Now the react application is ready to start
  ∘ Start the react app using the command "npm start".

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
